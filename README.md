This is my first ever web development project named as issue tracker. My project is integrated with both frontend and backend. I used HTML,CSS,JS for frontend part
and expressjs,nodejs,mongoDB for backend part. First of all there will be query form related IITGN sports with full validation of email and all. After submitting, the
data will be stored in Mongodb atlas. There will be an admin panel where the credentials are integrated with json web tokens. If the credentials are correct then it will
redirect to a new page where the person can see submitted data in a tabular form. There he can resolve and process the issue once the issue is resolved or processed the client
will receive a automail which was done using nodemailer function.
